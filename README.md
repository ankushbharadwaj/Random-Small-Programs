# Random-Small-Programs
Just a collection of random small programs that I've worked on not associated with a class or some larger project :)

[Word Search](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/Random-Small-Programs/blob/master/Word%20Search): The word_search function takes an input of a list of documents (which are strings) and a keyword. From this, it returns a list of the index values where that keyword showed up in the original list of documents, ignoring differences in case (uppercase vs. lowercase) and punctuation marks. The multi_word_search function uses this function to process a list of keywords, and instead returns a dictionary where each key is the keyword and the value is the list of indices that keyword was present in the documents list. Done in Python 3. 

[Randomly Generate Target String](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/Random-Small-Programs/blob/master/Randomly%20Generate%20Target%20String): With the provided input of a string, program "randomly" generates the target string by creating a random string of the same length, "mutating" the random string target_string.length times, then selecting the mutated string that is closest to the target string. Selected string then passed back the the mutate() function, and cycle continues until target string is reached, at which point, the "generations" or iterations of the cycle required to reach the target string are printed. Done in C++. 

[Blackjack Hand Comparison](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/Random-Small-Programs/blob/master/Blackjack%20Hand%20Comparison0): Pretty basic function that compares one hand to another in blackjack, returns True if the first hand beats the second hand and False otherwise. Done in Python 3.
